# 👋 Hey, I’m Steven

### Security Engineer | Automation Builder | Practical Problem Solver

I build tools that solve real operational problems. Most of my work lives at the intersection of security, automation, and systems that need to keep working when things go sideways.

I care about readable code, predictable behavior, and solutions that actually survive production.
